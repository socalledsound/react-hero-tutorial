code for a tutorial on state management in react and redux.
the idea here is to understand how state manangement in react and
redux works by

1.  building a simple game that manages state use a class-based component
2.  converting that state to our own simplistic implementation of redux
3.  actually implementing redux

Inspired by a few articles I read, one at Decembersoft's blog:
https://decembersoft.com/posts/redux-hero-part-1-a-hero-is-born-a-fun-introduction-to-redux-js/
and one on freecodecamp's blog:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-reduce-to-redux-understanding-redux-by-building-redux-918ef08abafe/

They're both really good, the Decembersoft article goes much deeper than this initial series of videos does,
into selectors and sagas. I'll make another series soon where I use redux toolkit and get into all of these
slightly more advanced concepts.

What I decided to do was to create a series of videos where we build something like these articles talk about, but with a UI.

There's a branch for the assets to get you started and then one for each of the videos.

main branch has the finished project

npm install then npm start
